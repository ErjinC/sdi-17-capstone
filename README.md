## Description
Maximum Bandwidth aims to give service members an accessible way to find and
interact with their bases' lemon lot, as well as other bases' lemon lots. Users will be
able to view listings, add listings, and manage their accounts for whenever their base/location changes.

Military members want an easy way to find a vehicle at an affordable price or sell their
vehicle, typically when they PCS in/out. A "lemon lot" is what military members use to
achieve this, but it is not a very well known tool and can quickly die due to not enough
members knowing about it.
